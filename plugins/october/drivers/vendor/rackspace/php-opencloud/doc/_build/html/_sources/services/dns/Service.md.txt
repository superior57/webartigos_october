DNS Service
===========

To instantiate a Compute service object, you first need to setup a
Rackspace/OpenStack client. To do this, or for more information, please
consult the `Clients documentation <../Clients.md>`__.

You will then need to run:

.. code:: php

    $service = $client->dnsService();
