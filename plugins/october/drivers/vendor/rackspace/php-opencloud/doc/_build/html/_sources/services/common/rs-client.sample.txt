Rackspace setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is to pass in your credentials and set up a client. For
Rackspace users, you will need your username and API key:

.. code-block:: php

  use OpenCloud\Rackspace;

  $client = new Rackspace(Rackspace::US_IDENTITY_ENDPOINT, array(
    'username' => '{username}',
    'apiKey'   => '{apiKey}',
  ));


OpenStack setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're an OpenStack user, you will also need to prove a few other
configuration parameters:

.. code-block:: php

  $client = new OpenCloud\OpenStack('{keystoneUrl}', array(
    'username' => '{username}',
    'password' => '{apiKey}',
    'tenantId' => '{tenantId}',
  ));
