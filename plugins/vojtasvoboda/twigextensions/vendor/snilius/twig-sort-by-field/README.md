# Twig SortByField Extension [![](https://img.shields.io/travis/victorhaggqvist/Twig-sort-by-field.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/victorhaggqvist/Twig-sort-by-field)
A Twig Extension filter to sort an array of entries (objects or arrays) by an entry field.

Since version 0.1.5 Doctrine collections can be sorted as is with no need to manually extract the array first.

## Install
With composer

    composer require snilius/twig-sort-by-field

## Usage
The list could look like this, but obviously with more than one key per array.

```php
$base = array(
  array(
    "name" => "Redmine"
  ),
  array(
    "name" => "GitLab"
  ),
  array(
    "name" => "Jenkins"
  ),
  array(
    "name" => "Piwik"
  )
);
```

```twig
{% for item in base | sortbyfield('name') %}

    {{ item.name }}

{% endfor %}
```

For Symfony usage you'll want to add it as a service and tag it for Twig.

```yml
# app/config/services.yml
services:
    twig.extension.sortbyfield:
        class: Snilius\Twig\SortByFieldExtension
        tags:
            - { name: twig.extension }
```
