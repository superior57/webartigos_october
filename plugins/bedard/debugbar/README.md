# Debugbar Plugin

Easily see what's going on under the hood of your October application.

### Usage

If you installed the plugin via October's plugin marketplace, just set ```debug``` to ```true``` in ```config/app.php```, and the debugbar should appear in your backend. If the plugin was installed without using the marketplace, you'll need to also run a ```composer update``` from ```/plugins/bedard/debugbar```. See [barryvdh/laravel-debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar) for more usage instructions and documentation. 

To include exceptions in the response header of ajax calls set ```debugAjax``` to ```true``` in ```config/app.php```.
